### We will regularly need to shuffle a vector. This function
### does that for us.
shuffle = function(X){
  new.order = sample.int(length(X))
  new.X = X[new.order]
  return(new.X)
}

### We will also often need to calculate MSE using an observed
### and a prediction vector. This is another useful function.
get.MSPE = function(Y, Y.hat){
  return(mean((Y - Y.hat)^2))
}

### Create k CV folds for a dataset of size n
get.folds = function(n, K) {
  ### Get the appropriate number of fold labels
  n.fold = ceiling(n / K) # Number of observations per fold (rounded up)
  fold.ids.raw = rep(1:K, times = n.fold) # Generate extra labels
  fold.ids = fold.ids.raw[1:n] # Keep only the correct number of labels
  
  ### Shuffle the fold labels
  folds.rand = fold.ids[sample.int(n)]
  
  return(folds.rand)
}
